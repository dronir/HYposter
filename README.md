# HYposter - LaTeX posters for University of Helsinki

This is a style file for `beamerposter` whose purpose is to simplify the process
of making scientific posters that have a University of Helsinki look with LaTeX.

`beamerposter` is a LaTeX package which uses `beamer` for typesetting posters.

HYposter is based on the Icy theme by Philippe Dreuw, although diverging rapidly.

## Requirements

LaTeX with [beamer] and [beamerposter]. Most modern LaTeX installations come with
`beamer` included, but you must install `beamerposter` yourself.

You also need pdf versions of the University of Helsinki flame logos for each
faculty. Unfortunately these can't be provided here as they are under copyright.
If you are university staff, you can get them (like I did) by downloading them
from the [official graphics repository]. Unfortunately they are mostly not
available in pdf format, so you must download them in some other format and
convert and rename. They are available in eps format, but for some reason
the epstopdf tool crashes on some of them.

Aternatively, if you are university staff, send a request to me at
olli.wilkman@iki.fi and I will send the pdf logos to you and save you the trouble.

A version which allows eps logos is on the todo-list.
