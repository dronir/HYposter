# HYposter - LaTeX posters for University of Helsinki

This is a style file for `beamerposter` whose purpose is to simplify the process
of making scientific posters that have a University of Helsinki look with LaTeX.

`beamerposter` is a LaTeX package which uses `beamer` for typesetting posters.

Based on the Icy theme by Philippe Dreuw, although diverging rapidly.

## Requirements

LaTeX with [beamer] and [beamerposter]. Most modern LaTeX installations come with
`beamer` included, but you must install `beamerposter` yourself.

You also need pdf versions of the University of Helsinki flame logos for each
faculty. Unfortunately these can't be provided here as they are under copyright.
